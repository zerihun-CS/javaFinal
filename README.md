# java OOP

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a fundamental programming paradigm based on the concept of “objects”. 
These objects can contain data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties) and code in the form of procedures (often known as methods).

The core concept of the object-oriented approach is to break complex problems into smaller objects.
